[THIS IS AN COMPLETED PROJECT](https://github.com/rachelsohzc/L.A-Crime-Analysis)

Predictive policing is becoming an important part for fair policing today. We wanted to find out if we could predict which areas would have crimes based on factors like victimâ€™s age, sex, descent, premise types etc. using decision trees and logistic regression models. The final product of this projects was to find out which inputs heavily influence severe crimes in Los Angeles.

I used multiple methods to cross-check the predictors in this project. You can find some of the methods below:

### Random Forests

Random forests are typically used for classification and regression. Considering the fact that our expected output was either severe or not severe crime, I chose to use random forests:

```
{{ tree1 = tree(Severity ~., data = crime)
summary(tree1)
plot(tree1) }}
```

### Logistic regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model that is also often used for classification and predictive analysis. It returns a probability of an outcome happening, so the outcome is always bounded between 0 and 1.

```
{{ logistic.crime6=glm(Severity~VictAge+Female+Weapon+SFamDwelling+Street+MUDwelling+Parking+Sidewalk+Vehicle+UnderParking+Black+Hispanic+Morning+Day+Night+Central+South+West, data=traindatafinal,family=binomial)
summary(logistic.crime6)

logistic.crime7=glm(Severity~VictAge+Female+Weapon+SFamDwelling+Street+MUDwelling+Parking+Sidewalk+Vehicle+Black+Hispanic+Morning+Day+Night+Central+South+West, data=traindatafinal,family=binomial)
summary(logistic.crime7) }}
```

The iterations above are done to find the most optimal model by removing variables.
