title = "About Me!"

Hi there! Iâ€™m Rachel, a Technology Graduate at HSBC and I graduated from the London School of Economics and Political Science with a BSc in Actuarial Science in 2022.

My interest in tech began after I took on a role as a committee member at the LSESU Data Science Society in my second year of university. Now, I work in the Cloud and Infrastructure Architecture department at HSBC as part of the Graduate Programme. My primary focus is on Net-Zero models, infrastructure designs on Google Cloud Platform, and data analysis.

I love all things tech :) But, I particular enjoy these fields:

* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Cloud Computing
* Big Data
* Sustainable technology/Net-Zero
* App development

And you can find me working on expanding my knowledge in the above technologies even outside work time - just like the work I've done with this website!
