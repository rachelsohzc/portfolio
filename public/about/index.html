                <p>Hi there! I’m Rachel, a Technology Graduate at HSBC and I graduated from the London School of Economics and Political Science with a BSc in Actuarial Science in 2022.</p>
<p>My interest in tech began after I took on a role as a committee member at the LSESU Data Science Society in my second year of university.

<p>I love all things tech :) But, I particular enjoy these fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</li>
<li>Cloud Computing</li>
<li>Big Data</li>
<li>Sustainable technology/Net-Zero</li>
<li>App development</li>
</ul>
<p>And you can find me working on expanding my knowledge in the above technologies even outside work time.</p>
