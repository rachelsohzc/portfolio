We wanted to find out if we could predict which areas would have crimes based on factors like victim’s age, sex, descent, premise types etc. using decision trees and logistic regression models. The final product of this projects was to find out which inputs heavily influence severe crimes in Los Angeles.&#xA;I used multiple methods to cross-check the predictors in this project.</description>
