Predictive policing is becoming an important part for fair policing today. We wanted to find out if we could predict which areas would have crimes based on factors like victimâ€™s age, sex, descent, premise types etc. using decision trees and logistic regression models. The final product of this projects was to find out which inputs heavily influence severe crimes in Los Angeles.
I used multiple methods to cross-check the predictors in this project.</description></item></channel></rss>
